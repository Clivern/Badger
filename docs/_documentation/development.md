## Development

Mut is built with Go. To run it locally, you need:

- Go 1.20 or later
- A database (PostgreSQL or SQLite)
- Make (optional, but recommended for using the Makefile)

### Installing Go

You can install Go using instructions from [the Go Installation Page](https://go.dev/doc/install). Make sure you have Go 1.20 or later:

```bash
$ go version
go version go1.20.4 linux/amd64
```
