## What is Mut?

Mut is a production-ready [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) Gateway that unifies multiple MCP servers into a single, manageable endpoint. Built with Go for speed and reliability, Mut serves as the central system for your AI infrastructure.

The Model Context Protocol is a standardized way for AI applications to communicate with external data sources and tools. Mut acts as a gateway that:

- **Unifies Multiple MCP Servers**: Connect and manage multiple MCP servers from a single endpoint
- **Provides Virtual Servers**: Compose custom MCP endpoints by mixing capabilities from different sources
- **Ensures Security**: Built-in authentication, authorization, and secure communication
- **Simplifies Management**: Beautiful web UI for configuration, monitoring, and management

Key benefits of using Mut include:

- **Multi-Protocol Support**: Seamlessly connects via `stdio` and `SSE` protocols
- **Auto-Discovery**: Automatic detection and registration of MCP server capabilities
- **High Performance**: Single binary, minimal footprint, optimized for production workloads
- **Centralized Management**: One dashboard to manage all your MCP infrastructure
- **Production Ready**: Easy to set up, deploy, and scale in minutes
